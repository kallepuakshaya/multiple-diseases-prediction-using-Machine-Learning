# multiple-diseases-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Machine learning project Description
A machine learning–powered web application that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases — Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s — based on user-provided health parameters.
Built with Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit, and deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy public access.

🚀 Features
Predicts multiple diseases using trained ML models.
User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
Real-time predictions based on input health data.
Deployed on Streamlit Cloud — no local setup required.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages: Python
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
Framework: Streamlit
Deployment: Streamlit Cloud

📦 How It Works
User enters health parameters into the web interface.
Data is preprocessed and passed to the trained ML model.
The app displays the prediction result instantly.
